As far as I can tell, no additional instructions are needed tro run this code!
(Besides the instructions in the base assignment)

Some AI (ChatGPT) was used for minor debugging, but I mostly used man pages and other online resources such as Beej's guide
for figuring out the needed logic. All code was written by me, as I wouldn't trust using anything I don't understand. I understand
the core differences between UDP and TCP now, as well as a more in depth understanding of Chandi Lamport, so I feel ready for what's next!
